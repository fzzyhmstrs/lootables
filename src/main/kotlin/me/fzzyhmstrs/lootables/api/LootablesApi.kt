    /**
     * Provide loot drops from a lootable table via loot choices, loot box style. A screen will pop up with the supplied number of rolls randomly selected as "tiles" for the user to choose from based on the number of choices supplied.
     * @param tableId [Identifier] - the resource location of the Lootable Table you want to supply loot from
     * @param playerEntity [ServerPlayerEntity] the player to supply loot to
     * @param origin [Vec3d] the location you want loot supplied to. This may not be applicable if, for example, loot is added directly to the player inventory. However, some loot will interact with the location, providing an AOE buff perhaps, or scattering loot on the ground, or summoning a mount, and so on.
     * @param onSuccess [BiConsumer]&lt;[ServerPlayerEntity], [Vec3d]&gt; action to take when choices are made successfully. This isn't run when this method returns true. That indicates that the choices were _generated_ successfully. This will fire when the player makes choices on the client side and the C2S confirmation packet is received on the server.
     * @param onAbort [BiConsumer]&lt;[ServerPlayerEntity], [Vec3d]&gt; action to take when choices are aborted by the player (not made). This isn't run when this method returns false. That indicates that the choices caouldn't be _generated_. This will fire when the player closes the screen for some reason before they make their loot choices. The choices generated will be stored, and if this method is called with the same tableId, player, and idkey, those aborted choices will be resent. This prevents players from, for example, continuously rerolling a loot bag item by escaping the choices screen until they get a roll they like.
     * @param key [IdKey], Nullable. A bounded key that indicates how many times this specific loot supply can be obtained by the player. Useful for containers that can only be looted once per player, for example. If null, no tracking will be done of how many times this supply is called for a specific player.
     * @param rolls Int, default 3. How many choice tiles will be rolled from the Lootable Tables available pools. If the Lootable Table doesn't have this many pools, it will supply all of its pools instead.
     * @param choices Int, default 1. How many tiles a user must pick before confirming their selection.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if choices is greater than rolls or rolls is less than 1.
     * @return true if the choices were successfully sent to the user, false otherwise. This is not confirming the loot is actually picked! The choices are made on the client and then sent back to the server for final supply. This means you will be able to send multiple requests even for a IdKey-bound call. Each request will override the one before it (reopen the choices screen), and user choices can still only be supplied a maximum if IdKey.count times.
